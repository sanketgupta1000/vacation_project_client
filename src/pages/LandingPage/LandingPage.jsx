              How does it work?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-md md:text-lg">
              If you have any books that you are done reading, you can upload
              them on this site. People will send you requests to borrow your
              books. You can either approve them or reject them. If you approve
              the request, you both will have to meet up somewhere to hand over
              the book. The book receiver will receive an OTP on their email,
              which they will have to share with the book giver to confirm the
              transaction of the book. Once the transaction is complete, the
              user will have 30 days to read the book, after 30 days the user
              will have to follow the same handover procedure to return the
              book. As mentioned earlier, users will also be able to borrow
              otherâ€™s books. However, a user can request or borrow only a single
              book at a time.
